Last 30min. of every class will be time for project questions, quandries and consultations. 

Materials used during classes will be shared in this repository in the coresponding folders. 

The environment set up for what we are starting with is explained here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/keras/keras_installation.htm. We'll be using python virtual environments and will have some time for set up and questions during our first class.
